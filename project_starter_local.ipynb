        "- Double-check your arithmetic: sum each activity price carefully\n",
        "- Consider using mental calculation or stating: \"Activity A costs X + Activity B costs Y = Total Z\"\n",

        "- Select at least ONE activity for EACH day (this is mandatory)\n",
        "- Choose activities at appropriate times (morning, lunch, afternoon, evening)\n",
        "- Ensure selected activities DO NOT overlap in time\n",
        "- CRITICAL: Use ONLY activity_ids that exist in the provided activities data\n",
        "- Do NOT invent or hallucinate activities\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 5: Quality Assurance Check\n",
        "- Verify all activity_ids exist in the available data\n",
        "- Confirm dates match the arrival and departure dates\n",
        "- Re-verify total cost calculation is accurate\n",
